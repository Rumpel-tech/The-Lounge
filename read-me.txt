🎨 UI Adjustments – Cool, Discreet, & Inclusive
Instead of joints and bongs, we’ll keep the buttons cool and unique but not overly obvious:
✅ "Enter Chat" → A sleek, glowing smoke ring animation.
✅ "Settings" → A minimalist, stylized grinder icon.
✅ "Media" → A chill wave pattern (like sound waves or smoke swirls).
✅ "Gaming VC" → A retro game controller icon.
✅ "Deep Talk" → A galaxy or infinity symbol (for cosmic convos).
✅ "Friends" → A simple spark emoji (like making connections).
✅ "Donate" → A small fire emoji (🔥 to support creators).

The idea is aesthetic, chill, and meaningful—but subtle enough that it won’t raise red flags if someone’s parents glance at it.
✅ XAMPP is a local server environment that includes Apache (for hosting), MySQL (for databases), and PHP (for backend scripting).
✅ It lets you test the site locally before going live.
✅ It simplifies database management (MySQL via phpMyAdmin).
✅ It’s good for traditional web apps but not ideal for real-time features like live chat (we’ll work around this).

🚀 The Full Vision – What the Chatroom Will Be Once Fully Built
A real-time, stoner-friendly chatroom where people can:
✅ Chat anonymously (no signup required).
✅ Sign up for more features (custom profiles, private rooms, voice chat).
✅ Share media (images/videos) with AI moderation (blocking illegal content).
✅ Tip creators (monetization feature).
✅ Join Voice Chat (gaming, deep talk, etc.).
✅ Safe spaces (NSFW verification for 18+ content).

🛠 The Foundation – What You’ll Start With (Using XAMPP)
Since XAMPP uses Apache, MySQL, and PHP, we’ll stick with PHP for the backend and WebSockets for real-time chat (without Firebase).

1️⃣ Setting Up XAMPP for the Project
✅ Install XAMPP (which you already have).
✅ Enable Apache & MySQL in the control panel.
✅ Place project files inside htdocs/ to run them locally.
✅ Use phpMyAdmin (built into XAMPP) to manage the database (for storing user profiles & chat logs).

2️⃣ Building the Basic Anonymous Chat (Without Signup)
🚀 Main Goal: Get real-time chat working, so people can talk without logging in.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP (XAMPP) + WebSockets (Ratchet or PHP-Push)
Database: MySQL (XAMPP’s built-in database)
Steps:
✅ Create a basic chatroom page (HTML + CSS).
✅ Use WebSockets (Ratchet for PHP) to handle real-time messages.
✅ Assign random guest usernames (e.g., ‘Stoner420’, ‘ChillVibes’).
✅ Store messages in MySQL (to keep chat history).

3️⃣ Adding Signup for Extra Features
🚀 Main Goal: Users who sign up get more access (custom profile, private rooms, media sharing, voice chat).

✅ Signup system using PHP & MySQL (simple login/register).
✅ Users get a profile, bio, and custom username.
✅ Add a friends list & private chatrooms.

4️⃣ Safe Media Sharing (Image & Video Uploads)
🚀 Main Goal: Users can share images & videos, but AI blocks illegal or explicit content.

✅ File Upload System (PHP + MySQL) to store images/videos.
✅ Use Google Cloud Vision API to scan images for nudity/violence.
✅ Block underage users from NSFW content (18+ verification).

5️⃣ Adding Voice Chat (VC) for Registered Users
🚀 Main Goal: Let users join voice channels to chill, game, or have deep talks.

✅ Use WebRTC (peer-to-peer voice calls) for free, low-lag voice chat.
✅ Add different VC rooms (gaming, stoner talk, deep convos, NSFW).
